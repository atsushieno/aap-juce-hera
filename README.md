This is a third CMake-baesd JUCE plugin ported to [aap-juce](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-juce): [Hera](https://github.com/jpcima/Hera), a modern JP-60 emulator plugin.

Only simple synthesis with the default set of parameters was verified to make some sound on aaphostsample and [aap-juce-plugin-host](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-juce-plugin-host).

This repository contains only a set of build scripts with almost no creative choices (which is a requirement for any copyright claims) but I leave GPLv3 license text for compatibility with Hera, JUCE and aap-juce.
